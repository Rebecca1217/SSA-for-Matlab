SSA-for-MATLAB
==============

This MATLAB SSA toolkit allowes one to perform SSA analisys and data forecasting just in a few command lines.
The toolkit has been developed for user-friendly use.
It includes SSA decomposition and recurrent SSA forecasting algorythms.
Each function contains extended reference descriptions and optimized to take a minimum set of input parameters.
All the above features provide a powerful and to-the-point SSA tool which is extremely easy to apply.

To get familiar with the toolkit learn the commented examples provided.
